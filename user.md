# Connect to the ownCloud Server Using a Desktop Client

The ownCloud Desktop Synchronization Client is available for Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows. You can download the client from the [ownCloud download page](https://owncloud.com/download/#desktop-clients).

On MacOS and Windows, the client installs similar to any other software application. Simply download the application, double-click on it, and follow the instructions in the installation wizard. When prompted, enter the IP address or hostname for your ownCloud server as provided by your administrator.

On Linux, you must follow the instructions on the [Linux download page](https://software.opensuse.org/download/package?project=isv:ownCloud:desktop&package=owncloud-client) for your specific distribution. You must also have a password manager (such as GNOME keyring) available in your distribution. When prompted, connect to the ownCloud server using the IP address or hostname provided by your administrator.

For more information on installing and using the ownCloud Destop Client, see the [ownCloud Client Manual](https://doc.owncloud.org/desktop/2.5/#).
